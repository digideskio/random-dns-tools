Some random DNS tools I use
===========================

These are mostly undocumented random stuff.

* clean-se.sh - get the list of domains in a .se zone file
* getds.pl
* getns.pl - get all name servers from a zone file
* mx.pl - get all MX records from a list of domains
* nsstats.pl - count domains per NS
